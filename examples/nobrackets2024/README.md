The NoBrackets 2024 example shows how to setup CTFd for this event.

Original stylesheet and images are the property of GCC and were granted free right of use by [GCC](https://github.com/gcc-ensibs).

We modified the stylesheet to be based upon `core-beta` for compatibility purposes with recent CTFd versions API, to support the white and dark themes, and due to [ctfd-chall-manager plugin](https://github.com/ctfer-io/ctfd-chall-manager) limitations.
